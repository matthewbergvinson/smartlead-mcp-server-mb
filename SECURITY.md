## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Security**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure secret management
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Limit API key permissions to minimum required

2. **Environment Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use the latest version of SmartLead MCP Server
   - Monitor for security advisories
   - Use secure network connections

3. **Configuration Security**
   - Review MCP client configurations
   - Limit server access to trusted clients only
   - Use proper file permissions for configuration files
   - Regularly audit server logs

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions in production
   - Review dependency licenses and security policies

3. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Validate API responses
   - Handle authentication errors properly

## Known Security Considerations

### API Key Exposure

- API keys are passed as environment variables
- Ensure proper process isolation in shared environments
- Consider using secret management systems in production

### Network Security

- All API communications use HTTPS
- No sensitive data is logged by default
- Consider network-level security controls

### Input Validation

- All inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- SQL injection is not applicable (REST API client)
- XSS protection through proper output encoding
